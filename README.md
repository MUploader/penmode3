# penmode3
When pentest hits the "cloud"

### You can't use the name "penmode" in your project!!
Why? Is it your trademark? I don't think so.

I've started to develop penmode since its first line.<br/>
The Team split up, but I think that continuing the project with its true name is not a shame.

Thanks.
