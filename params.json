And run the Frontend from everywhere, just with a simple Internet connection.<br/>\r\nAnd you can make Frontend in every language you want!<br/>\r\nPeople asking for Android/iOS Penmode can have a Native Application!<br/>\r\nRead the [wiki](http://github.com/TheZ3ro/penmode3/wiki) for more information!\r\n\r\n#### How Do I install Penmode3?\r\nIf you have a working Node.js & NPM setup, just type<br/>\r\n`npm install penmode3`<br/>\r\nFor other instruction read the [Readme](http://github.com/TheZ3ro/penmode3)\r\n\r\n#### How Do I install Penmode3 Plugins?\r\nDownload this [penmode3-plugin Repo](http://github.com/TheZ3ro/penmode3-penmode)\r\nand start penmode3 with<br/>\r\n`penmode3 --plugins /downloaded_folder`\r\n\r\n#### When I can use Penmode3? (Use-Case)\r\n * You want to run your pentest from your powerfull VPS/Server\r\n * Your (company) firewall does not allow you to access some ports on the target system \r\n * You don't know how to use your Raspberry Pi\r\n * More...\r\n\r\nLet me know how/when you use Penmode3 in the most strange way on Twitter with the hashtag [#Penmode3](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Penmode3&src=typd)\r\n\r\n#### How Penmode3 works?\r\nRead the [wiki](http://github.com/TheZ3ro/penmode3/wiki)\r\n\r\n#### How can I write new Penmode3 Plugins?\r\nRead the [wiki](http://github.com/TheZ3ro/penmode3/wiki)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### You can't use the name \"penmode\" in your project!!\r\nWhy? It's your trademark? I don't think so.\r\n\r\nI've started develop penmode1 since its first line.<br/>\r\nThe Team split up, but I think that continue the project with its true name is not a shame.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nI'm developing Penmode3 alone, others Team member are doing different things.<br/>\r\nAn ex-member and his team is working on a project named **Pen-Box**.<br/>\r\nAnother ex-member is working on a OSINT All-In-One tool named **Naonis**.<br/>\r\nGo search for that, both seems interesting! \r\n \r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nTheZero, ex-PH#0S Team Member\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
